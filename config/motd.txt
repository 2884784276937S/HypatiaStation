-<i>This server is running custom build of <a href="http://baystation12.net/">Baystation 12's</a> modification of the <a href="http://nanotrasen.com/">/tg/station13</a> SS13 code.</i>
<br><br>
Here at Hypatia, we run 24/7 Extended roleplay, and have occasional custom events that are conducive to roleplay. We try to provide the best quality roleplaying enviroment possible and hope that you can help us ensure this.
<br><br>
If you’re new here, perhaps consider checking out our forums: <a href="http://hypatiastation.net/forum/index.php/">
<br><br>
At that point, you can also take a visit to our Wiki to see our unique lore, and also read some guides to playing on Hypatia. Alongside that, you can also read some discussions that the regular Hypatians are having, and participate them as well.
<br><br>
Now, make sure to read our rules, located in the top right. Ignorance isn’t an excuse, so make sure you read them thoroughly so you don’t break the rules whilst playing. We wouldn’t want to have anybody banned.
<br><br>
Remember to ALWAYS remain in character whilst playing here. If you have any other concerns, simply hit F1 to adminhelp your problems. Enjoy your time here, and have fun roleplaying!
<br><br>
Sincerely, the Hypatia Administration and Moderation staff.
