<p>These are the most current and up to date rules for Hypatia. Obeying the rules will make your stay fun and RP able and disobeying will get you banned.<br>
<br><b>Respect admins.</b> We try to not for favorites but we are human and it might happen. Do not give us reason to dislike you.
<b><br>RP properly.</b> This is an RP server, so make an effort to RP correctly and use proper English. Don't go around and ruin the game for other players by being a general jerk.
<b><br>No blatant racism, sexism, or hate talk.</b> Having a racist character that isn't just going around and refusing to work with who they hate or speaking in completely racist terms is okay, but don't be completely unRPable with it and do not bring it into OOC. Don't go around and ruin the game for other players by being a general jerk.
<b><br>No non-consensual eRP.</b> This would be not discussed before rape of characters or posting on the radio of the game things that are highly sexual in nature. Do not attempt it in OOC either, it will get you banned.
<b><br>When an admin PMs you about something, reply to it.</b> When we message you, generally speaking we are asking for your side of the story or expect and answer. Not giving it can result very badly for the player.
<b><br>It is a game.</b> Do not take it to serious, and do not get upset at admins when we don't do what you want.
<b><br>Do not advertise other servers.</b> This is a server, we don't care about the other ones, nor what they are doing.
<b><br>Do not PM admins about OOC being off.</b> More then likely there is a reason or that we are making the players RP on an RP server.
</p>
<p><b>No plasma grief.</b> It causes lag and issues, none of which is appreciated here.
<b><br>Don't rob/grief brain deads.</b> There isn't a real need for this (barring it relating to the occasional antag) and if they return later on, they will not appreciate it either.
<b>We do use baystation law for our station.</b> It is better suited for the RP that we do on the server. Please do know it before playing security.
<b><br>Role play pain upon receiving and injury.</b> This is something that isn't done very often and should happen more often on an RP server.
<b><br>Don't metagame.</b> If you are a janitor, you wouldn't know robotics. If you are a security officer, you wouldn't know genetics. Play within your character.
<b><br>No IC in OOC or vise versa.</b> It ruins player RP and just is frowned upon. This includes using out of game methods of communicating about the players or things happening on the server. Do not use things like Skype, Steam or anything to tell someone you are dead and where they can find your body.
<b><br>If you are griefed, adminhelp it.</b> If we don't know about it, we can't do anything about it. Don't yell about it in OOC if it's on, just adminhelp it.
<b><br>Don't put titles in your name.</b> The ID you get should have only your name, first and last, and your occupation. We don't need to see Mr., Mrs., Dr., things like that on IDs.
<b><br>Don't insult or curse at admins.</b> It's irritating and is likely to get you banned, especially when it's hate talk or just really bad insults. Cursing is bad as well, so telling us to “Fuck off” is likely to get you banned as well.
<b><br>Listen to admins and moderators. Please, it avoids so many issues.</b> Just listen, be respectful to us and we will return the favor. It does no good to mindlessly argue with us.
<b><br>There is rarely a need to kill.</b> Don't go killing because someone looked at you wrong, or if new accidentally disarmed you. Work it out, call security, do something other then kill if you can avoid it. It is grief, and is bannable.
<b><br>Don't engage in shuttle grief.</b> It's bad RP. Just because the round is ending, doesn't mean that you can go killing everyone for fun.
<b><br>Don't raid the armory.</b> It causes grief, there isn't a need for the weapons unless at very specific circumstances, and is something we take very serious here.
<b><br>Suicide is against the rules.</b> Unless there is extensive RP behind it, there is no need for the suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Just because something isn't listed here, doesn't mean it's not a 
rule.&nbsp; </strong><em>&quot;Common&quot; Sense</em> applies.&nbsp; Just because it 
doesn't say &quot;No destroying the station via over-pressurisation&quot; doesn't mean you 
can do it.&nbsp; If an admin says it's a rule, <strong>it's a rule</strong>.&nbsp; 
Excuses such as &quot;it says nowhere in the rules that we aren't allowed to do this&quot;
<strong>are not</strong> acceptable.</p>
